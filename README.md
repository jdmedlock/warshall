# Warshall

This repo contains a modified version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm that is
designed to identify nodes in a dependency matrix that are part of a cycle. 
This was developed to generate sample results from test data to be included in
this [Medium.com article](https://medium.com/@jdmedlock/why-should-i-give-a-dag-e5f4a1f6ac7).
